    After losing its championship run in Season 8 against its rival, ONIC Esports, RRQ Hoshi made a lot of preparations for its fated rematch. The team announced Rivaldi “7” Fatah as the new team captain with Petra "Fiel" Giovanni as the new head coach.
    The team showed dominance since the regular season, as it topped the leaderboard with 12 wins and two losses, and also secured its upper bracket slot. RRQ Hoshi even dropped ONIC Esports down to the lower bracket final after a 3-2 victory. However, ONIC Esports stood firm and defeated AURA Fire to reach the grand finals.
ONIC Esports was able to turn the tides in game two thanks to Nicky "Kiboy" Fernando’s impressive Selena gameplay. However, RRQ Hoshi was able to reverse the odds in its favor and went on to a three-game win streak to secure the championship title.
