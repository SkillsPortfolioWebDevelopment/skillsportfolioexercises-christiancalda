<h1>During the weeks leading up to TI10, GosuGamers will be taking a closer look back at the meta for each of The Internationals through the years. This week is TI8.</h1>

    We are towards the tail end of the journey to look at the metas which blessed the former versions of The International, and our penultimate stop is one of the craziest esports stories to ever have unfolded. The International 2018, or TI8, will be remembered for quite a few reasons, including the fact that it possibly had the best TI grand finals to date.

    TI8 was held at the Rogers Arena in Vancouver, which was the first time it had travelled from Seattle since 2018. The prize pool for the tournament, thanks to the TI8 Battle Pass, had gone up to nearly $25.5 million from $24.8 million from the previous year. The winners of TI8 were destined to get the same percentage as the winners of TI7 – 44%, which came out to be a little over $11.2 million.
